# FeeBo - A Feedback Sharing Platform

This is my learning project where I built a website that lets people share and read feedback about products or services. I created this to learn modern web development technologies.

## What FeeBo Does

- Let users share feedback without needing to sign up
- Show all feedback in an organized way
- Filter feedback by different categories
- Simple and easy-to-use design

## What I Learned and Used

During this project, I got to work with:

### Frontend (Website Part)
- HTML and CSS for making the pages
- React for building the website
- Tailwind CSS for making it a bit good

### Backend (Server Part)
- Node.js and Express for the server
- MongoDB for storing the feedback

## How to Run the Project

1. Get the project from GitHub:
   ```bash
   # Make a folder
   mkdir FeeBo

   # Clone this repository
   git clone https://github.com/arbitcoper/FeeBo.git
   
   # Go into the project folder
   cd FeeBo
   ```

2. Install what's needed:
   ```bash
   # For the website part
   cd client
   npm install

   # For the server part
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the project:
   ```bash
   # Start server (in terminal 1)
   cd server
   npm run dev

   # Start website (in terminal 2)
   cd client
   npm start
   ```


## My Learning Journey

- How websites work from front to back
- Working with databases
- Making user-friendly interfaces
- Using Git for project management
